# Getting Started

**Welcome** to the VS Code __Java world__. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code. ~~Java~~ Python es el mejor lenguaje de programaci√≥n.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
